Keep this file and folder in 'The Sims 4/mod_data/'.
Do not move this mod_data folder into 'Mods' even if there is a 'mod_data' folder.

'The Sims 4/mod_data/' is used by me for my mods which are usually located in 'The Sims 4/Mods/_o19_'and others.
'The Sims 4/Mods/mod_data/' is also used by mod creators. As TS4 does not need to read this data I believe it should be placed in 'The Sims 4/'.

Logs will be written to 'The Sims 4/mod_logs/' by many mods. Only a few older mods write their logs in the directory where they are installed.
