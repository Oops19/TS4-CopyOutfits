CopyOutfits v1.9.0 for The Sims 4 v1.107.151 and S4CL v3.4
Created on 2024-07-04
v1.9.0
    Experimental support for mannequins
    TS4lib requires an update.
    This mod doesn't create a new outfit (dress the mannequin) when replacing the 'bathing' outfit.
    Most useful interactions: 'Clone > Everything', 'Mannequin > Skins | Add'
    'Clone > Characteristics' may require a 'Reset' to apply these.
    Allow to add non-existing outfits to sims.
    Allow to de-/spawn mannequins on the floor, also off-lot.
    Fixed Age.PET
    Added Age.HORSE
    Added X-OutfitCategory.SPECIAL[FASHION]
    Outfit order is now: BATHING; SITUATION; CAREER.[0-2]; SPECIAL.[DEFAULT,TOWEL,FASHION]; BATUU.[0-4] with picker hint notification.
    Address exception "_on_outfit_change() 'missing 2 required positional arguments: 'sim_info_wrapper' and 'outfit_category_and_index'" within a 3rd party mod.
