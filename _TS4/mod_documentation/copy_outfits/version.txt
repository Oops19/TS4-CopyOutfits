CopyOutfits v1.9.9 for The Sims 4 v1.110.311 and S4CL v3.9
Created on 2024-11-13
v1.9.9
    Yet another release to address the broken skin for sims.
    Remaining CAS Part flags are 'Child or Elder, Female and/or Male'.
    This may still cause skin issues for child end elder sims while mannequins can still use it.
    In case of skin issues set the default head with 's4clib.attach_cas_part head_id 3'. The default head_id for 'female male child' are 6977 8860 and 27816.
    Especially for (child and elder) occult sims these CAS parts are still selected by TS4 even if the referenced image/skin resource is missing.
    Hopefully EA fixes this TS4 bug one day and verifies that the referenced images actually exists before using a CAS Part.
